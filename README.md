### **📌 Devpost Submission**
#### **WildVision - AI-Powered Wildlife Identification for Conservation**
**🏆 Hackathon: Calgary Hacks 2025**  
**Category:** Wildlife Conservation in the Context of Climate Change  

#### **🚀 Inspiration**
Climate change is rapidly threatening wildlife populations worldwide. Many species are at risk of extinction, yet public awareness remains low. We wanted to create a **simple, AI-driven tool** that allows users to identify animals and learn about their conservation status.

#### **💡 What It Does**
- Users **upload an image** of an animal  
- OpenAI’s **GPT-4 Vision model** analyzes the image and returns the species name  
- (Future Feature) The app will display **extinction risk, population trends, and climate impact data**  

#### **🛠️ How We Built It**
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Flask + OpenAI API for image recognition  
- **Development Environment:** Running React (`npm run dev`) and Flask (`flask --app run`) concurrently  

#### **🚀 What’s Impressive**
- **We built this from scratch!** Before this class, we had **zero** experience with React, Flask, or APIs.  
- **Live AI-powered image recognition** in a lightweight web app.  
- **Future potential:** With conservation data integration, this could be a valuable tool for researchers and the public alike.  

#### **🌟 Challenges We Overcame**
- **API integration hurdles**: Parsing image data correctly to OpenAI's API  
- **Frontend-backend communication**: Setting up CORS and handling file uploads  
- **Learning curve**: We had to learn React, Flask, and backend logic **on the fly**  

#### **📈 Future Enhancements**
- 🔍 Integration with wildlife databases to provide conservation status  
- 📊 Data visualization to display population decline trends  
- 📱 Mobile-friendly UI for broader accessibility  

#### **🎯 Judging Criteria**
✅ **Idea:** Addresses conservation education through AI-powered species recognition  
✅ **Implementation:** Fully functional AI-based image classification within a short timeframe  
✅ **Design & Presentation:** A clean, intuitive UI built with **React + Tailwind CSS**
